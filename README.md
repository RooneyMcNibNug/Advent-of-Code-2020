# Advent-of-Code-2020
My repo for https://adventofcode.com/2020/ solutions - attempting in Rust.

I am currently going through The Rust Programming Language "book" (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) as I am only somewhat familiar with the language and am looking to start using it more practically.

I am not a developer!
